# Platform

When I think about the South End, I’m reminded of countless places, people, and times that have been essential in showing me what makes Burlington so amazing.

Here, **people pursue their passions** through their work, providing unique goods and services in a way that is only possible in the neighborhood’s unique built environment.

Here, **the environment is cherished**, appreciated, and used responsibly in some of the city’s most beautiful public natural areas.

Here, **the community works together** to come to collective solutions, at large across the South End and on the person-to-person scale in co-working spaces and industrial incubators where innovators support each other as their ideas take off.

Here, **we care about our transportation network** and hope that as we move into the future, our roads are accessible, safe, and suited for the green transit of the present and future in all seasons.

Here, **individuals are empowered to grow** and thrive regardless of their background or identity by forward thinking, empathetic community groups and organizations.

As the **City Councilor for Ward 5**, I want to build off this community’s strengths, by **listening** to the desires of the people of this community and by living to my personal desire to **create a more just, benevolent future.** The specific angles I will work towards in this campaign and as **your councilor** will be:

* Increasing transparency and accessibility in city government to allow for greater meaningful public participation in all stages of government.

* Creating an equitable local economy by ensuring livable wages and creating greater opportunity for creators, artists, and small businesses, empowering workers to pursue their passions in our city.

* Addressing housing affordability in the city by empowering renters, creating pathways for the creation of workforce housing, and pursuing innovative solutions for increasing density in a way that works for the people of Burlington.

* Combatting climate change by taking tangible steps to address inefficiencies in our roads and in our homes.
