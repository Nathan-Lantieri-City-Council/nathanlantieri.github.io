# Platform

When I think about the South End, I’m reminded of countless places, people, and times that have been essential in showing me what makes Burlington so amazing. Here, people pursue their passions through their work, providing unique goods and services in a way that is only possible in the neighborhood’s unique built environment. Here, the environment is cherished, appreciated, and used responsibly in some of the city’s most beautiful public natural areas. Here, the community works together to come to collective solutions, at large across the South End and on the person-to-person scale in co-working spaces and industrial incubators where innovators support each other as their ideas take off. Here, we care about our transportation network and hope that as we move into the future, our roads are accessible, safe, and suited for the green transit of the present and future in all seasons. Here, individuals are empowered to grow and thrive regardless of their background or identity by forward thinking, empathetic community groups and organizations.

As the City Councilor for Ward 5, I want to build off of this community’s strengths, while recognizing we can do more to create truly inclusive, affordable housing through innovative solutions, empower workers to foster a more equitable local economy from the bottom-up, taking tangible steps to ensure that our homes and roads are ecologically sustainable, and enable community involvement in city operations through greater transparency and access in the city decision-making process.
