                                <p>Every day I spend in Burlington, I’m thankful to be able to call this city my home. There’s an incredible vitality here that’s unlike so many other places. People talk to each other and care about their community, they spend time outside enjoying the natural beauty and eclectic economy, they work to make this place and the whole world a more just and progressive place to live. They see Burlington the way I do – it’s a place that fosters the kind of forward-thinking attitude that can combat the pervasive issues of the day and of the future.</p>
                                <p>Across the country, we have seen rising economic inequality created by dwindling opportunity and the consolidation of capital. Today in Burlington, the same is true. Affordable housing is scarce, the minimum wage is not a livable wage, and many recently enacted policies bolster the profits of those at the top, not empower Burlington’s greatest asset – it’s people. In recent years, city government has moved away from what makes this city the place I love, moving away from the people’s vision of progress.</p>
                                <p>Burlington can be a city where everyone can find an affordable home, make a decent wage in a fulfilling job, and still have the energy to play a meaningful role in our community regardless of their background or identity. It can be the city that empowers individuals to make a difference, leading the way in the pursuit of environment, social, and economic sustainability.</p>
                                <p>That is why I am running for City Council in Ward 5. We can realign our city government with the views of the people. We can make innovative decisions and we can tackle the issues of the day together.</p>
