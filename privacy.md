# Privacy Policy

Nathan Lantieri for Burlington City Council is committed to protecting your privacy. Accordingly, we’ve created this policy to explain our privacy practices. This policy applies to nateforburlington.com only; it does not apply to other websites.

## Collection of your Personal Information

We collect a variety of personal information about those who register on our site or use other functions or features on the site. Personal information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about activities that are directly linked to that person. You may make changes to the information you have provided by visiting any form throughout the nateforburlington.com site or by contacting us at natelantieribtv@gmail.com.

In addition to the information that you enter on the site, we automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us online. For example, when you visit our site, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser you use. Information may be automatically collected through the use of “cookies” (more information below).

We do not currently accept donations at nateforburlington.com; all donations are processed through Anedot.com. When you donate through Anedot, you will need to provide your name, address, occupation and name of employer, credit card information, billing address, and confirm that we may legally accept your contribution. Anedot will provide us with your name, address, occupation, employer, and any additional contact information that you use when donating, but not your credit card information.

## Use of Cookies

We may use cookies to tailor your experience on our site according to the preferences you have specified. When you visit nateforburlington.com, your browser saves a tiny piece of information on your computer. This information personalizes and improves your experience online.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience all the features of nateforburlington.com.

## Use and Disclosure of your Personal Information

nateforburlington.com may collect and use your personal information to operate nateforburlington.com and deliver the services you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content based upon the information we have collected.

Information about our donors and website visitors is one of our most important assets and therefore we keep it confidential. Personal information is made available to others for the following, limited purposes:

To Comply with Campaign Finance Laws. We are required to disclose information regarding our contributions to comply with campaign finance laws. Federal law requires us to use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar year.

To Carry Out Your Requests. We also may be required to disclose personal information in order to carry out your requests when you use the site. This may include sharing your personal information with our third-party vendors. For example, we will share personal information with third parties as necessary to deliver you email updates.

To Protect You and Ourselves. We release personal information when we believe release is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena); to protect our rights or property; to protect our donors and supporters from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful conduct; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires the disclosure of communications or records.

To Support Like-Minded Candidates and Organizations. We may disclose selected personal information to other campaigns and organizations that we believe are like-minded or that we believe you may wish to hear from.

## Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information

We care about the safety and privacy of children online, and we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with COPPA, children under the age of 13 should not provide any personal information on this site. We urge parents to supervise their children while online.

## How Do We Protect Your information?

We employ a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information. For example, we use commercially reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees and third-party vendors who need to know that information to provide services to you. Further, we store the personal information we collect from you behind a secure firewall and place the transaction site on a secure server. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input and allows you to view your information in a secure manner.

We have no control over the security of other sites on the Internet you might visit, interact with, or from which you buy products or services.

## Links to Other Websites

We may provide links to third-party websites as a service to our visitors. We are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those sites. These sites’ privacy policies may differ from ours and we encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.

## Unsubscribe Policy

If you no longer wish to receive emails from Nathan Lantieri for Burlington City Council, please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of all of our emails.

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise and update this policy if our practices change, if we add new features to the site, or if we change existing ones that affect these practices. You should refer back to this page often for the latest information.
